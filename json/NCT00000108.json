Heart attacks and stroke are the leading cause of death in older women. Reduced\r\n      variability of the heart rate and increased dips and swings in blood pressure are risks\r\n      factors that predict the chance of developing CVD as are increased levels of clotting\r\n      protein fibrinogen and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, and high levels of LDL-cholesterol\r\n      (>160mg/dl). We will be measuring all of these risk factors and any changes in your body fat\r\n      level before you start training and after 15 and 30 weeks of training in the form of\r\n      walking. At the present time the effects of exercise intensity on these factors are not well\r\n      understood. This study will add to the basic understanding of these issues and allow us to\r\n      recommend to postmenopausal women optimal exercise intensities to lose body fat and reduce\r\n      the risk of developing CVD.\r\n    "]}],"overall_status":["Completed"],"phase":["N/A"],"study_type":["Interventional"],"study_design":["Allocation: Randomized, Intervention Model: Parallel Assignment, Primary Purpose: Prevention"],"condition":["Cardiovascular Diseases","Coronary Disease"],"intervention":[{"intervention_type":["Behavioral"],"intervention_name":["Exercise"]}],"eligibility":[{"criteria":[{"textblock":["\r\n        Inclusion Criteria:\r\n\r\n          -  Postmenopausal and preferably on hormone replacement therapy\r\n\r\n          -  In good general health\r\n\r\n          -  Have a body mass index (BMI, weight in kg/height in m2) of between 25 and 40\r\n\r\n          -  Exercise less than 20 min/day two days a week\r\n      "]}],"gender":["Female"],"minimum_age":["50 Years"],"maximum_age":["65 Years"],"healthy_volunteers":["Accepts Healthy Volunteers"]}],"location":[{"facility":[{"name":["3060G Central Campus Recreation Bldg 401 Washtenaw Ave."],"address":[{"city":["Ann Arbor"],"state":["Michigan"],"zip":["48109-2214"],"country":["United States"]}]}]}],"location_countries":[{"country":["United States"]}],"verification_date":["December 2003"],"lastchanged_date":["June 23, 2005"],"firstreceived_date":["January 18, 2000"],"keyword":["exercise"],"has_expanded_access":["No"],"condition_browse":[{"mesh_term":["Cardiovascular Diseases","Coronary Artery Disease","Coronary Disease"]}]}}
